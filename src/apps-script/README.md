# Hays + Sons — Customer & Job Database (Google Apps Script)

This folder holds the **entire backend** for the app's customer/job database: storage and
authentication. It is designed to be copied into the Apps Script editor and run once.

The backend is **one single file — `Code.gs`** — so setup is one paste. After pasting, press
**Ctrl+End** and check the end: the last line must be a single `}` and the file must match the line
count printed by `npm run apps:ascii`. (The backend was split into six files for a while to dodge
paste truncation in the Apps Script editor; `node scripts/split-once.mjs` regenerates that fallback
if a big paste ever truncates again — see troubleshooting.)

| File | Lines | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Code.gs` | ~2400 | The complete backend: configuration, provisioning, auth, jobs, self test |
| `appsscript.json` | — | Project manifest (timezone, scopes, web-app access) |

Everything is dependency-free — no libraries, no `clasp`, no build step.

> **Keep `Code.gs` pure ASCII.** The file reaches the Apps Script editor by copy-paste, so a
> multi-byte character (em dash, curly quote, non-breaking space) can be mangled in transit. Use `-`
> instead of `—`, straight quotes instead of curly ones, and a plain space instead of a non-breaking
> space. `npm run apps:ascii` checks the file and fails the build if this regresses.

## 1. Set it up (one command)

1. Go to **[script.google.com](https://script.google.com)** → **New project**.
2. Rename the project to `Hays + Sons DB`.
3. Clear the placeholder first: click into the editor, press **Ctrl+A** then **Delete** (deleting it
   only halfway is the classic cause of an `Unexpected end of input` error - a leftover
   `function myFunction() {` leaves an unclosed brace). Then paste in the **entire** `Code.gs`, from
   the first line to the final `}`. Save it, then press **Ctrl+End** - the last line must be `}`.
   If the paste arrives cut short (some clipboards cap around 25 KB - see Troubleshooting), clear the
   editor and paste the numbered parts from `src/apps-script/paste-chunks/` instead, one after
   another, pressing **Ctrl+End** between pastes.
4. Open **Project Settings** → tick **"Show `appsscript.json` manifest file in editor"**, then open the
   `appsscript.json` tab and replace its contents with the provided `appsscript.json`.
5. Click **Save**, then select **`setupDatabase`** in the function dropdown and click **Run**, then
   approve the permission prompt. Google will ask for *"See, edit, create and delete your
   spreadsheets"* and *"Connect to an external service"*. Both are required.

   > `setupDatabase()` also accepts an email, name and password to create your first admin account —
   > but the editor's **Run button cannot pass arguments to a function**. To create that account, use
   > the login page's **Create account** button (sign-up is open by default), or add a temporary
   > wrapper like this and run *that*:
   >
   > ```js
   > function bootstrap() {
   >   setupDatabase('you@example.com', 'Your Name', 'a-strong-password');
   > }
   > ```

That single call provisions **everything**:

- a spreadsheet named **`Hays + Sons - Customer & Job Database`**
- a **`Jobs`** sheet — one row per saved job
- an **`AuditLog`** sheet — append-only trail of who changed what
- a **`Users`** sheet — login accounts (the `Salt` and `PasswordHash` columns are hidden)
- a **`Sessions`** sheet — active logins (the `Token` column is hidden)
- a **`Drafts`** sheet — the shared workspace draft, i.e. the record currently being edited (one row; the `PayloadJson` column is hidden)
- a **`README`** sheet documenting the schema inside the spreadsheet itself
- optionally, your **first administrator account** (only when you pass the three arguments)

`setupDatabase()` is **idempotent** — run it as often as you like, in any order, to repair or upgrade.
Calling it with **no arguments** also provisions everything and simply skips creating the account.

> If step 5 is skipped entirely, the **first web request provisions the database automatically**, so a
> fresh deployment is never left half-built. The `ping` response reports `provisionedNow: true` when
> that happens.

### Where the data lives

This spreadsheet is the **system of record** — the single place every account reads from and writes to,
so signing in from any machine shows the same customer and job data.

| Data | Stored in | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Saved jobs | `Jobs` sheet | Full record JSON per row; soft-deleted rows are flagged, never removed. |
| In-progress record (workspace draft) | `Drafts` sheet | Autosaved as you type, so an unfinished job is never stranded on one device. |
| Change history | `AuditLog` sheet | Who saved, deleted or cleared what, and when. |
| Accounts and logins | `Users` / `Sessions` sheets | Only credential *hashes* are stored. |

Two things stay on the device on purpose, and neither is customer data:

- the **session token**, so a page reload does not sign you out (`Sessions` holds the server side);
- an **offline cache** of the jobs list, plus an outbox of edits made while offline. Every queued
  write is replayed to this backend as soon as the device is online — the cache is a copy, never the
  only home for a record. Queued writes are tagged with the account that made them, so on a shared
  machine one person's unsaved edits are never shown to, or published by, anyone else.

`saveDraft` / `getDraft` are the two actions behind the shared draft, and the `Drafts` sheet is
created on first use, so an already-provisioned spreadsheet does not need a repair run.

### Accounts

Login is handled by the app's own sign-in page. Credentials are checked against the `Users` sheet, and
a short-lived bearer token is issued, recorded in `Sessions` and sent with every subsequent request.

Create or reset an account from the Apps Script editor:

    createUser('russell@haysandsons.com', 'Russell Shive', 'a-strong-password', 'admin')

Roles are `admin`, `editor` and `viewer`. Running it for an existing email resets that account in place.

| Helper | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `createUser(email, name, password, role)` | Create an account, or reset an existing password. |
| `enableRegistration()` | Open sign-up to anyone with the URL (the default). No arguments. |
| `disableRegistration()` | Refuse all sign-up. No arguments. |
| `useInviteCode()` | Require an invite code; generates one and logs it. No arguments. |
| `setRegistrationMode('open'\|"invite"\|'off')` | Set the sign-up policy explicitly. |
| `setRegistrationCode(code, domains?, role?)` | Invite mode with a code you choose, plus an optional domain list. |
| `getRegistrationInfo()` | Log the registration state without revealing the invite code. |
| `listUsers()` | Log every account without exposing credentials. |
| `setUserActive(email, true/false)` | Enable or disable an account without deleting it. |
| `cleanupSessions()` | Remove expired sessions. Safe on a daily time-driven trigger. |
| `revokeAllSessions()` | Sign everyone out immediately. |
| `showInstallInfo()` | Log configuration plus account and session counts. |

**Passwords are never stored in plain text.** Each account carries a random salt and an iterated
HMAC-SHA256 derivation — Apps Script has no bcrypt or argon2, so a high-iteration HMAC is the strongest
primitive available natively. An account locks for 15 minutes after 5 failed attempts, and failures are
reported uniformly so the endpoint cannot be used to discover which email addresses exist.

**Sessions** last 12 hours. The browser keeps the token in `localStorage` and re-verifies it with the
server on load, so reloading the page keeps you signed in.

### Self-service sign-up

The login page has a **Create account** button. Anyone who has the app URL can click it, enter their
email, choose a password, and they are signed straight in. No administrator involvement, no invite
code — **this is on by default.**

Accounts created this way get the `editor` role, and can never be `admin`.

#### Locking it down (optional)

The policy lives in the `REGISTRATION_MODE` Script Property. Change it from the Apps Script editor:
pick the function in the dropdown, click **Run**, then read **View → Logs**.

    disableRegistration()   // refuse all sign-up
    useInviteCode()         // require an invite code; generates one and logs it
    enableRegistration()    // back to open sign-up (the default)

These take no arguments deliberately — the editor's Run button cannot pass arguments to a function.
They take effect immediately with **no redeploy needed**, because Script Properties are shared between
the editor and the deployed web app.

For finer control, call these directly by wrapping them in a temporary function:

    setRegistrationCode('a-long-code')                    // invite mode, with a code you choose
    setRegistrationCode('a-long-code', 'haysandsons.com') // invite mode + domain restriction
    setRegistrationMode('off')                            // same as disableRegistration()

| Mode | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `open` (default) | Anyone with the URL can create an account |
| `invite` | An invite code of at least 12 characters is required |
| `off` | Sign-up is refused; accounts come from `createUser()` only |

#### What is always enforced

Whatever the mode, these hold:

- **Never an administrator.** New accounts get `editor`, or whatever `REGISTRATION_DEFAULT_ROLE` says;
  `admin` is silently clamped to `editor`.
- **Passwords are hashed** with a per-user salt, exactly as for accounts you create yourself.
- **Optional domain allow-list** narrows any mode. Matching is exact, so `not-haysandsons.com` does not
  pass for `haysandsons.com`.
- **Every attempt is audited**, successful or not, in `AuditLog`.
- **In `invite` mode** the code is compared in constant time *before* the `Users` sheet is read, so a
  wrong code cannot be used to discover which emails already have accounts.

> **Before you widen access:** a row in `Jobs` carries the customer's address, insurance claim details
> and the last four digits of their SSN. In `open` mode, anyone who obtains the web-app URL can create
> an account and read all of it. If that matters, run `useInviteCode()` or
> `setRegistrationCode(code, 'haysandsons.com')`.

## 2. Optional Script Properties

**None of these are required** when using the login page. Add them under
**Project Settings → Script Properties** only if you want the extra behaviour.

| Property | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DB_SHEET_NAME` / `LOG_SHEET_NAME` | `Jobs` / `AuditLog` | Override the default sheet names. |
| `USERS_SHEET_NAME` / `SESSIONS_SHEET_NAME` | `Users` / `Sessions` | Override the account/session sheet names. |
| `ALLOWED_EMAILS` / `ALLOWED_CLIENT_ID` | *(unset)* | Enable the **legacy** Google ID-token path alongside the login page. |
| `SHARED_SECRET` | *(unset)* | **Developer bypass — disables authentication entirely.** Never set in production. |
| `REQUIRE_ID_TOKEN` | `true` | Only affects the legacy ID-token path. |

Session length is not a Script Property — change `DEFAULTS.SESSION_HOURS` in `Code.gs` (`12` by default).

---

## 3. Verify

Run **`selfTest()`**. It provisions on demand, then exercises the real spreadsheet end-to-end and
reports **`SELF TEST PASSED`** in the execution log (View → Logs). It confirms that:

- created currency strings like `"$24,850.00"` come back as the number `24850`
- blank `number | ''` fields stay blank instead of turning into `0`
- `"FALSE"` becomes boolean `false` (not truthy)
- `"yes"` is repaired to the exact union value `Yes`
- updating does **not** duplicate the row
- login issues a token, that token authorises a request, wrong passwords and unknown accounts are
  rejected, logout revokes the session, and no plain-text password is stored

It cleans up every temporary record and account it creates.

---

## 4. Deploy as a web app

**Deploy → New deployment → Select type: Web app**

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Description | `Hays + Sons DB v2` |
| Execute as | **Me** |
| Who has access | **Anyone** |

Click **Deploy** and copy the **`/exec`** URL.

> **Why "Anyone"?** Access is enforced by the application login, not by Google session cookies. A
> cross-origin `fetch` from the browser does not carry Google's session anyway, so "Anyone with a
> Google account" would not add any protection.

Whenever you change `Code.gs`, use **Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit → Version: New version**.
A brand-new deployment URL is only created if you add a *new* deployment, so the app's URL stays stable.

---

## 5. Point the front-end at it

Add to `.env.local` in the project root:

```
VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL="https://script.google.com/macros/s/XXXXXXXX/exec"
VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXX.apps.googleusercontent.com"
```

Restart the dev server afterwards.

---

## 6. API reference

All requests are `POST` to the `/exec` URL with
`Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8` and a JSON body.

> Apps Script does not answer CORS preflight requests, so `application/json` **must not** be used —
> `text/plain` is a CORS "simple request" and goes straight through.

Every response is **HTTP 200** with a JSON envelope — always branch on `ok`, never on the status code:

```json
{ "ok": true,  "data": { }, "schemaVersion": 1 }
{ "ok": false, "code": "forbidden", "error": "This account is not permitted to access the database." }
```

| Action | Body | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ping` | *(none — no auth needed)* | `{ pong, schemaVersion, time }` |
| `saveJob` | `{ job }` | `{ record, created, recordId }` |
| `listJobs` | `{ includeDeleted?, limit? }` | `{ jobs: [...], count }` |
| `getJob` | `{ recordId }` or `{ jobNumber }` | `{ job, updatedAt, updatedBy }` |
| `deleteJob` | `{ recordId, hard? }` | `{ deleted, hard, recordId }` |
| `searchJobs` | `{ query, includeDeleted?, limit? }` | `{ jobs: [...], count, query }` |

Authenticated actions also accept `idToken` (the Google ID token). Example:

```json
{ "action": "getJob", "idToken": "<jwt>", "recordId": "b1e2..." }
```

Error codes: `missing_action`, `unknown_action`, `unauthenticated`, `forbidden`, `not_configured`,
`invalid_job`, `invalid_record`, `not_found`, `corrupt_record`, `busy`, `internal_error`.

---

## 7. How data is stored

One row per job in `Jobs`. Human-readable columns are indexed for searching; the complete record
lives in `RecordJson` and is the source of truth when reloading.

Concurrent writes are serialised with `LockService`, so two saves can never interleave.
Deletes are **soft** by default (a `Deleted` flag), keeping the audit trail intact.

### Round-trip safety
Spreadsheets mangle data in well-known ways, so `normalizeRecord_()` repairs every one of them
before a record is returned:

| Hazard | Handled |
| --- | --- |
| Currency written as text | `"$24,850.00"` → `24850` |
| Blank `number \| ''` field | stays `''`, never becomes `0` |
| `"FALSE"` / `"0"` | becomes boolean `false`, not truthy |
| Union casing (`"yes"`, `"INCREASE"`) | repaired to `Yes`, `increase` |
| Missing fields | materialised from a canonical template so UI inputs stay controlled |
| Unknown/new fields | preserved, so schema additions need no migration |

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| `Syntax error: ... Unexpected end of input line: N` | The pasted copy is missing a closing `}` somewhere before its end - **line N is the end of the pasted file, not the line with the mistake**. Click into the editor, press **Ctrl+A**, delete, then paste the whole file in again. |
| `Unexpected end of input` at the same line every time (e.g. `line: 623`), while `npm run apps:ascii` reports the file is fine | The paste is being cut short before the end - large preview panes and some clipboards cap around 25 KB (about 620 lines of `Code.gs`). Clear the editor, then paste `src/apps-script/paste-chunks/part1.txt` through `part6.txt` in order (**Ctrl+End** between each). Regenerate after edits with `npm run apps:chunks`. |
| `Syntax error: ... Invalid or unexpected token`, reported at a `/**` comment opener | The paste was cut short inside a block comment. Same fix. If a ~2400-line paste keeps truncating, run `node scripts/split-once.mjs` to regenerate six smaller files and paste those instead, or paste in two halves and join them at a section banner. |
| `not_configured` | Run `setupDatabase()` first. |
| Every request returns `forbidden` | `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is not set, or your email/domain is not listed. |
| `unauthenticated: Sign-in token was rejected` | `ALLOWED_CLIENT_ID` does not match the client that issued the token, or the token expired. |
| Browser console shows a CORS error | The request used `application/json`. Use `text/plain;charset=utf-8`. |
| Manifest rejected on save | You omitted the `oauthScopes` entries; re-paste `appsscript.json` exactly. |
| Changes have no effect | You edited the code but did not create a **new version** of the deployment. |
| The login page has no **Create account** button | The button only appears when the deployed backend reports sign-up is on: a `registrationInfo` probe answering `"enabled":false` means it is off. Turn it on with `enableRegistration()` (open sign-up) or `useInviteCode()` (invite-only) on current builds, or deploy the current `Code.gs` (open by default) as a **new version**, then refresh the app. |
| `The database is busy` | Another write holds the lock; retry. |

Paste problems are the most common failure of all, and the reported line is always the **end** of the
pasted file rather than the real mistake. `npm run apps:ascii` prints the file's line count; after
pasting, press **Ctrl+End** — the last line must contain only `}`. If a one-shot paste keeps arriving
short, use the parts in `src/apps-script/paste-chunks/` (regenerate with `npm run apps:chunks`).

To confirm the deployment is live, open the `/exec` URL in a browser — it performs a `ping` and
should show `{"ok":true,...}` **without revealing any data**.

---

## 9. Security notes

- Nothing is served until `ALLOWED_EMAILS` is configured. The script **fails closed**.
- Requests are authenticated by verifying a Google ID token server-side before any data is touched.
- `SHARED_SECRET` is a deliberate developer bypass — leave it empty in production.
- The spreadsheet is **not** shared publicly; only the script owner needs access, because the web app
  executes as the owner.
- `RecordId` and `RecordJson` columns are hidden in the sheet to reduce accidental edits.

| 3 | `JobName` | |
| 4 | `CustomerName` | Property owner |
| 5 | `Email` | |
| 6 | `MobilePhone` | |
| 7 | `LossAddress` | |
| 8 | `Carrier` | |
| 9 | `ClaimNumber` | |
| 10 | `Status` | `Draft` / `Active` / `On Hold` / `Complete` / `Cancelled` |
| 11 | `CreatedAt` | `YYYY-MM-DD` |
